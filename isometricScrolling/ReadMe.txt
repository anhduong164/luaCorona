This was just playing around with Coronaâ€¦ I created a test of a "toy" game engine over a month or two in my spare time, that would be an isometric adventure/rpg game.  

The test assets are ripped from Final Fantasy Tactics. I used a Corona SDK add-on developed by Jonathan Beebe (beebegames.lua) and implemented a basic joystick API from Corona's pages also.
